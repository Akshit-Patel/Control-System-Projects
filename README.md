# Control System Projects
This repository contains some common problems to control systems and their MATLAB SIMULINK solutions. Also resources required to understand these problems are provided. This is updated weekly. Please open a issue in case of any discrepancy or further update. 


**Problem 1 - Closed Loop PID speed control for mathematical model of BLDC Motor**

This is a starter problem in which a basic mathematical model of BLDC motor is designed and controlled via PID. Same controller is designed with both MATLAB and SIMULINK

**Problem 2 - Normal PID, Self Tuning Fuzzy PID and PID with Genetic Algorithm for Angle Control of Inverted Pendulum**

An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over. It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a control system to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.
